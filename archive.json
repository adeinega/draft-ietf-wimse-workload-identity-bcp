      "body": "At our recent conference call we talked about better aligning the content of the draft with the title of the document. The body of the document talks about the use of JWTs with OAuth 2.0 in a container environment utilizing token change. The title is, however, so generic that we could also describe other practices. Among the authors we had not planned to extend the scope (of course, to be confirmed by the group). \r\n \r\nI asked ChatGPT for a few suggestions regarding the title and here are the options:\r\n\r\n- \"Best Current Practice for Secure Workload Identity Management\"\r\n- \"Best Current Practice in OAuth-Based Workload Identity\"\r\n- \"Best Current Practice for JWT-Based Workload Identity\"\r\n- \"Best Current Practice for Workload Identity in Container Orchestration\"\r\n- \"Best Current Practice for Workload Identity Using OAuth 2.0 and JWT\"\r\n- \r\n\r\nI like the last one best. What do others think?\r\n",

Workloads can use this token to authenticate themselves towards APIs of the platform control plane. Even though this token is used for access it can be more considered an ID Token rather than an Access Token in the OAuth context. Workloads don't get issued a refresh token nor does authorization or consent play a role. It is merely a proof that the workloads is who it claims to be. Workloads have various options available to retrieve such token from the Kubernetes platform, for example via a `TokenRequest` API invoked by business logic or `Token volume projection` which mounts the token into the file system of the workloads and keeps it up to date there. `Token volume projection` having the advantage of not requiring any manual effort by the application besides reading a file.\r\n```",
